    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>

      My name is Silas Clark. I am 9 years old. I like basketball.
  I also like golf, but I don't like it nearly as much. I also
  like soccer, but  not nearly as much.

<h3>Family</h3>

      I have a sister named Lucinda, but she goes by Lulu. I
  have a mom named Ceinwyn, and I don't know really what she
  prefers to be called. Finally, my dad's name is Steve, and he
  prefers to be called Steve.Click here to go to <a href="family.html">my family.</a> I bet you

   and their names are Alice and Maude. Click here to go to
