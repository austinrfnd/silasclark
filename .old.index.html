      I like basketball. I also like four square. I pretty much like everything even close to related to sports.
      The way you play 4 square is you draw one immense square on a flat surface, then you make that square into 4
      equal pieces. Then number each one one-four. In the far end of square one, draw a triangle that takes up about
      29% of the square. These are the rules:


      Players may be eliminated from the court because of errors or fouls they commit. Eliminated players leave the court, the remaining players move up to the next highest square, and a new player joins the court in the lowest square. Eliminated players wait in line for their next turn. In school play, the line can sometimes exceed 6 people.

      The following actions may result in elimination (although many variations exist):

      Failing to hit the ball into another square<br />
      Hitting the ball out of turn<br />
      Hitting the ball incorrectly<br />
      Hitting the ball out of bounds<br />
      Letting the ball drop twice on a player's own square<br />
      Hitting the ball so that it bounces in another square without it bouncing in your own square<br />
