<p>     Shaquille O'neal (Shaq) was the most dominant center on the LA Lakers. He was also the man on the Lakers
to make 39 free throws in a game, even though he's terrible at shooting them. The reason for this is because
the other team fouled him so they could have the ball after he occasionally would miss them both. But he was not
in the mood for missing that day!
